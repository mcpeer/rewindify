cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

4. Start the backend server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
